Lots of supports were given by my dear girlfriend Tianhui Wu when I was obtaining undergraduate education at Shandong University of Technology from September 2015 to June 2019. I spent most of my time in my laboratory career, committed to learning the way of a sane person thinking, so that ignored her frequently. We don't have plenty of romantic moments during this period due to the long distance between the place of my university and hers. Every reunion is fleeting and precious. We only convey the deep affection of each other through video-chat or phone-call in the normal time. We have done a little thing which other lovers usually did at the university. So, I decided to compose a book to collect and sort out what I have studied and projects which I have done in my university laboratory career, for a gift to her to appreciate and as a return for her patience, tolerance and anything she paid for me. Hence the book --- \textsl{A bite of Wu Tianhui}, got published. The reason why this such name was named for this book is the thing I most want to do to convey my love is bite (and kiss, and even chew) her chubby face deeply. \\
