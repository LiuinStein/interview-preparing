# 0x00 Preparing a code interview

Here is a part of my book *A bite of Wu Tianhui* aimed to introduce how to prepare a code interview, mainly talking about some questions and its answers about Java and some developing frameworks which interviewers usually ask. This part also includes a chapter about basic computer science, such as database technology, software engineering, artificial intelligence and compiler mechanism.

This repository contains the $\LaTeX$ code of this book, please download all of files included and compile it with your favorite $\LaTeXâ€‹$ compiler (XeLaTeX recommended here) to watch it.

> Warning
>
> I'm using the `minted` $\LaTeX$ package to highlight codes inside, please note that you must invoke $\LaTeX$ compiler with the `-shell-escape` flag, and a Python environment with `pygmentize` library was configured in your machine.
